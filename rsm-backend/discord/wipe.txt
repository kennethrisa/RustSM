How to wipe server in discord

!set seed <seednr>
!set update 1 (if you need to update the server)
!set wipe 1 (based on your sets)
!say Server will wipe in 10 min!
!restart (will restart based on whats in restart.txt, default 600)

### AFTER WIPE ###
!set wipe 0 (if this is not 0, on restart it will wipe the server again, this is verry important)
